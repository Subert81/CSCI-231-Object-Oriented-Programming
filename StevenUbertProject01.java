/*6)Changing "System" to "system" and compiling brings up a syntax error becasuse
 * Java is case sensitive
 * 7)Breaking the line of code bring up a run-time error because Java requires

 * 8)Changing "System.out.println" to "System.out.print" will still run the program with no
 * issues but it's a logic error. Because "println" will print the current line then
 * drops to the next line where as "print" doesn't
